# ExponentialPro

The project utilizes data from the Indian Financial Data Science Hackathon 2019([Analytics Vidhya](#ref4), [Mishra, S.](#ref5), [Bhavsar, N., 2019](#ref6)), where 470 teams competed, and the dataset has since been downloaded 1,960 times on Kaggle, resulting in seven published projects. The hackathon's AUC-ROC evaluation method recorded a leader's result of 0.67317. Given that a few years have passed since 2019, this project aims to explore advancements that could improve predictions. As a first-time endeavor in Financial Data Science, the primary objective is to gain experience with Data Science tools and techniques while leveraging clean and well-researched data.

The goal is to learn and optimize three classifying algorithms at an intermediate level: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and the recently popularized GXBoost, which is known for its exceptional performance([Bentéjac, C., Csörgő, A. and Martínez-Muñoz, G., 2021](#ref7)). The project will compare results using the competition's metrics. While Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines will not be explained in detail, a brief overview of GXBoost will be provided. GXBoost is a scalable ensemble technique based on gradient boosting that has proven to be a dependable and efficient machine learning challenge solver([Rao, C., Liu, Y. and Goh, M., 2022](#ref8)).
